I had a dream
oh what a dream
I saw the shape
of things to come
then I awoke
it was no joke
I'd seen the shape
of things to come
Kitsch is a beautiful word
it's a beautiful word
it's a beautiful lullaby
I saw a queen
all dressed in green
but I could see
she had no soul
I see the moon
shining in June
what we all need
is Rock and Roll
Kitsch is a beautiful word
it's a beautiful word
it's a beautiful lullaby
Old plastic macs
and Cadillac's
prawn cocktails
steak
and lovely wine
just do your thing
and we'll all sing
so here we go
now take your time
Kitsch is a beautiful word
it's a beautiful word
it's a beautiful lullaby
